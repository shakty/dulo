 *
 * The options for player and admin server are specified by the
 * `playerServer` and `adminServer` properties here.
 *
 * If they share the same options, then just a string with
 * the name of the two different connection endpoints must be specified.
 *
 * If different options apply to each server, `playerServer` and `adminServer`
 * they must be specified as configuration objects, with the name of
 * the _endpoint_ specified as a key in the object.
